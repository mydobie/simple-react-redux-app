1.  To turn on the lint on save:
1.  In VSC, go to `Code > Preferences > Settings`.
1.  Open the `Text Editor` section
1.  Click on `Formatting`
1.  Check the `Format on Save` section

1.  Install the ESLint extension (see link above)

The above steps will install all the pieces, but VSC needs to be told to use Prettier to reformat on save.

1.  Press `command` + `shift` + `p`
1.  Select `Format Document`

Now when you make a change and save any `.tsx` fileRepeat the above process for other file types including `.ts` and `.html` files.

1.  Copy the `settings.json` and `launch.json` files into the `.vscode` directory
1.  Install the `Jest` extension (see link above)
1.  The results of the tests will be displayed in the test file and at the bottom of the VSC window.
