Selectors pull data from the redux store so individual components
don't need to know the store structure

***** Naming *****
All selector names are camel case starting with a lower case letter.
All selector names should end with "Selector" to avoid confusion when applied

If the returned value of the selection is a boolean then the name should start with "is"

If the returned value is not a boolean, the the name should start with "get"

For example: "isErrorSelector" or "getErrorMessageSelector"

// export const mySelector = (state) => state.KEY_FROM_STATE;
