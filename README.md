## Description:

CHANGE ME => Brief description of what this application does.

CHANGE ME => [See app in action]()

## Get me started:

At the root of the project run the following commands in a terminal to verify you can perform all the development tasks:

1.  Verify node is installed => `node -v`. Ensure that it is version listed in the `engines` section of the `package.json` file.
1.  Install dependencies => `npm run d`
1.  Verify you can check for lint errors => `npm run lint`
1.  Verify you can run the tests => `npm run test`
1.  Verify you can check for security advisories => `npm run npmAudit`
1.  Start dev server using mocked data => `npm run start:mock` then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
1.  Verify you can build production files => `npm run build`
1.  Verify you can make tar for deployment => `npm run createTar`

## Versioning

The version of the application is done automatically when merging a pull request into the main branch. Do not increment the version on the package.json file manually. See [Contributing.md](CONTRUBUTING.md) for more information.

## Node

The only requirement is that development system has Node.js installed. You can verify you have node installed by running `node -v` in a terminal.

NOTE: The development tools require a node version listed in the `engines` section of the `package.json` file.

If have an different version of node running, first verify if you have NVM installed by running `nvm --version` in a terminal. If you do have NVM running, then see the [NVM website](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on how to install and use a new version of Node.

If you don't have Node nor NVM installed, see the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/) on how to install Node.

Alternatively you can choose to develop this application inside a Docker container instead of modifying the version of node or NVM on your machine. See the `DOCKER_DEV_ENV/README.md` file for more information. This is the recommended method for development.

## Install dependencies

After checking out the project, run `npm run d` in a terminal at the root of the project to install dependencies.

After installing dependencies, you can check to see what dependencies are out of date by running `npm outdated` in a terminal at the root of the project.

## Check security stats of dependencies

You can check if there is any high or critical security advisories for installed dependencies by running `npm run npmAudit`.

This project uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to automatically install Git Hooks that will check for security advisories in the `dependencies` section of `package.json` at commit time. Commits will fail if any dependency has a high or critical security advisory. See the `.husky/pre-commit` file. This means that you cannot commit code until high or critical security advisories are resolved. This was done intentionally because resolving high or critical security advisories is always the highest priority.

## Start the development server

To start the development server with mocked data, run `npm run start:mock` in a terminal at the root of the project. If you want to run the application making real API calls, run `npm run start`.

This will start the application in development mode and open the application in a browser. Note the application will not build if there are any linting errors.

The application wil be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

If you need to change the port the application is running on, then change the `PORT` value in the `.env` file. This `PORT` value is only used for the development server and will not impact a production or production-like (like staging) environment.

### Run tests

To run the tests, run `npm run test` in a terminal the root of the project.

After running tests, you can check the coverage reports by opening `coverage/index.html` in a browser or by running `npm run checkCoverage` in a terminal.

Test are run in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect), use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to inspect components, and [jest-axe](https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe) to check for accessibility.

#### Snapshot tests

This application may use snapshot tests. If there is any change to the HTML, there may be a need to update the snapshot files. This can be done by running `npm run test:update` in a terminal window.

NOTE: Generally snapshots are not recommended, but are a good start when more detailed tests aren't possible or feasible.

### Linting

You can check the linting status of your files by running `npm run lint` in a terminal at the root of the project.

To fix known issue, you can run `npm run lint:fix`. NOTE: You may need to run this command multiple times until you get a successful run in order to fix all issues.

More information on fixing linting errors is available at: [esLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) | [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) |[airbnb JS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

This application uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically install Git Hooks that will check for linting errors on files at commit time. All linting errors must be fixed before changes can be committed to git.

### Build

Normally a tar file with the built (production-ready) files needs to be created so it can be loaded to an artifact repository. To build and create a tar file of the built files run `npm run createTar`

If you want to create the built (production-ready) without creating a tar file, run `npm run build` in a terminal at the root of the project. This will create production-ready files in a `build` directory.

## GitHub actions

This repository uses numerous GitHub actions to run tests, create artifacts, and create tags. Many of these actions will happen automatically, but some of them can be run manually.

The status of any actions can be viewed on the actions page. The action files are located in the `.github/workflows` directory.

### Run tests

All pull requests will have the following tests run:

- Linting
- Check for high or critical security advisories
- Unit tests
- Check for adequate test coverage (see `utils/testCoverage.js`)
- Verify that the code can be built

If you want to run these tests against another branch, you can do the following at any time:

1. In GitHub, go to the the actions menu and select "Test Code".
1. Click "Run workflow" drop down.
1. Choose the branch you want to run the tests against.

If you get a "Workflow does not exist or does not have a workflow_dispatch trigger in this branch" warning, be sure that the `.github/workflows/test_and_build.yml` file exists on the branch.

### Update version, publish artifact, update demo site

When a pull request is merged into the `main` branch, the following is automatically run.

- Linting
- Check for high or critical security advisories
- Unit tests
- Check for adequate test coverage (see `utils/testCoverage.js`)
- Updates version on package.json (see [CONTRIBUTING for more information](CONTRIBUTING.md))
- Creates a release
- Publishes artifact to GitHub
- Updates the demo site on the `gh-pages` branch.

**Note** that these series of actions can take a while. Check the actions page to see if there are any actions still running.

**Note** that you will need to manually update the release text. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) on what is required for the release text.
